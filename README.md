From 2015 to 2020, I worked as a programmer on ECM (Enterprise Content Management) projects for companies such as MegaFon, Norilsk Nickel, Severstal, AlfaStrakhovanie, and Ilim Group.
Tech stack: C#, Java, Python, Oracle SQL, PostgreSQL.

From 2020 to 2025, I developed the Python ORM system Epure and studied mathematics via YouTube, having completed the following courses:

Set Theory and Logic – E.V. Dashkov, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT)
Abstract Algebra – N.A. Vavilov, Saint Petersburg State University (SPbU)
Algebra – A.B. Kalmynin, Independent University of Moscow (IUM)
General Topology – K.L. Kozlov, Moscow State University (MSU)
Calculus – A.G. Davtyan, MIPT
Measure Theory – I.G. Erlikh, MIPT
Real Analysis – M.I. Dyachenko, MSU
Probability Theory – D.A. Shabanov, MSU


Project "Reward for Debunking the Discovery".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Nikita Umerov and On October 17 I published an article titled "On Algebraic Integral" on the Zenodo portal. Four respected professors independently verified it as a scientific discovery - I don't disclose their names for confidentiality reasons. The article became popular: on the first evening, it was downloaded 70 times and continues to get about 50 downloads per week, which is an indicator of interest for a paper in abstract algebra.

However, the main source of information about mathematical discoveries remains the arXiv website. arXiv promises to review submissions in "two business days in general," but I had to wait a month and a half with no information about the status of my submission. Waiting was painfull due to the importance of publication priority. Support provided no information, and in the end, I received a rejection only after emailing the archive's Editorial Advisory Council.


The rejection text states that the "submission does not contain sufficient original or substantive scholarly research and is not of interest to arXiv." However, under the assumption that the service reflects the interests of the scientific community, this claim directly contradicts the observed facts: the article's popularity on Zenodo, its verification by four specialists in algebra and calculus who focus on the article's topic, and 44 citations within two months of the preprint's publication.

This leads to a hypothesis: the arXiv decision does not reflect the interests of the scientific community, and the work was rejected not due to a lack of scientific merit, but due to the author's lack of institutional affiliation and, possibly, non-standard formatting. This is a fact: the author even has no formal scientific education. To test this hypothesis, I am initiating a public social experiment consisting of two parts.


Experiment Goal: to measure the level of interest within the scientific community for a discovery that was rejected by the arXiv administration.

Part 1: Scientific Verification — Reward for Debunking
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am announcing a reward of 400 Toncoin to the first person who:

1)Finds a critical error in Theorem 2 (the key result of the article), OR
2)Finds a counterexample to Theorem 2, OR
3)Provides the identifier of an article, preprint, or monograph where this result was published earlier. I also need the source itself if it is not publicly available.

Considering the volatility of the cryptocurrency over the past three years, the amount is equivalent to ~400–1000 USD. The amount is modest, but it represents all my savings.

Procedure:

1)Submissions for the reward are accepted at the email: rewardForDebunking@gmail.com
2)The email must contain a scientifically grounded refutation and a Toncoin wallet address (the address can be provided after the refutation is verified).
3)I will try to respond to all emails within two business days, but this depends on the volume of correspondence.
4)In case of successful verification, I will immediately transfer the tokens to the specified wallet, publish the essence of the refutation (with a link if necessary), and, at the recipient's discretion, their name.
5)In case of a denied claim, you may file a public appeal in the comments of the YouTube video (link below).

If the discovery withstands this verification, it will serve as a strong indicator of its novelty and correctness. In addition to the article link, I provide a link to a YouTube video that presents the formulation of Theorem 2 and part of its proof — for those who may find the article's formulation too complex.

Part 2. Endorse me
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second part of the experiment relies on the so-called Endorsement system of the arXiv service. To publish an article on arXiv, any person must first receive an endorsement from the system or from a person who already has a certain number of papers on the portal. 

Each endorsement from a person implies that the endorser, after an initial review, considers the work worthy of consideration by the scientific community — to assume otherwise would be absurd and disrespectful to the endorsers: "We don't expect you to read the paper in detail, or verify that the work is correct, but you should check that the paper is appropriate for the subject area. You should not endorse the author if the author is unfamiliar with the basic facts of the field, or if the work is entirely disconnected with current work in the area." — a quote from the arXiv website.

At the start of the experiment, the author has received two endorsements out of four requests - that is, 50% positive responses rate from the sample. In one case, the author received no response; in another, a direct refusal was given due to the author's lack of affiliation and the reputational risks that endorsing an unaffiliated researcher entails for a professor. I will continue to track endorsement statistics and publish them here until I pay the reward for the first part of the experiment.

Endorsements requested: 4

Endorsements received: 2 (50% positive response rate)

In the author's opinion, this metric may reflect the level of the community's acceptance of the result and its potential demand.
